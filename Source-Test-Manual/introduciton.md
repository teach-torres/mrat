# Introduction

The  Apex  Instruments  isokinetic  source  sampling  system  enables  the  operator  to  extract  a  gas sample from a stack isokinetically.  The word “isokinetic” is comprised of two Greek root words “Iso”  meaning  “the  same  as”  and  “Kinetic”  meaning  “relating  to  motion  of  material  bodies.”  Isokinetic  Samplingis  therefore  the  extraction  of  a  gas  sample  from  a gas stream at the same velocity as the gas travels in the stack.   Isokinetic sampling is necessary  because of the inertial effects of particulate matter in a gas stream.  The isokinetic sampling ratio, or percent isokinetic (%I),  is  the  ratio  of  the  sample  velocity  at  the  inlet  of  the  sampling  nozzle  to  the  stack  gas velocity.  

Isokinetic testing requires a through understanding of the first five test methods presented in Title 40 Part 60 Appendix A of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR60 App. A). Method 5 provides the general sampling train operation protocol but Methods 1 through 4 prescribe techniques underpinning the sampling activities associated with Method 5. Together, these methods outline the basic protocols for determining particulate concentrations and mass emission rates.

The  basic  Method  5  sampling  train  is  easily  adapted to test for many other gaseous and particulate parameters   of   interest   from   stationary   sources.   Parameters   of   interest   may   include   metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins/furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particle size  distributions  and  an  ever-increasing  group  of pollutants  by  adaptations  of  basic  test  methods. While  the  different  methods  are  designated  by  other US EPA or agency method numbers, they are variations  of  Method  5  procedures  such  as  using:  different  impinger  solutions,  organic  resin  traps, different filter media, sampling temperatures or a range of other alternative procedures.

## System Description

The Apex Instruments isokinetic source sampling system consists of five (5) main components,

1.Source Sampler Console which includes a dual column manometer, sample flow control valves with orifice flow meter, dry gas meter, and electrical controls. The Console is  housed in a weather resistant ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW) custom designed case complete with carry strap. 

2.External Sample Pump Vane or Dual Diaphragm including hoses with quick-connect fittings and lubricator. 

3.Probe Assembly includes a SS probe sheath, probe liner, tube heater, Type-S pitot tubes, stack and heater Type K thermocouples and an Orsat line. 

4.Modular Sample Case includes hot box for filter assembly, cold box for impinger glassware, and electrical connections.    

5.Umbilical Cable includes electrical and pneumatic lines to connect the Modular Sample Case to the sample pump and Source Sampler Console.

### Source Sampler Console 

The Source Sampler Console is the operator’s control station that monitors gas velocity and temperatures at the sampling location and controls system sampling rate and system temperatures. Figure 1-2 illustrates the Apex Instruments Model XC-522 Source Sampler Console’s front panel. The Model 522 is the English standard version and the Model 572 metric version.  

Field  assembly  and  set-up  is  simplified.    The  connections  for  sample  line,  pitot  tube  lines, vacuum pump (non-reversible), and electrical (4-pin circular connector and Thermocouple jacks) are all located on the front panel for easy access.The XC Case has a removable front and back covers for easy access.

The Series 500 Source Sampler Consoles includes: 

- Double-Column Inclined/Vertical 250-mm (10-inch) Manometer and Flow Control Valves to monitor stack gas velocity pressure, head and orifice pressure to achieve isokinetic sampling. 

- Dry Gas Meter with direct read numeric totalizer to 9999.9999 cubic meter sample volume capacity; in cubic meters (4.4 cubic meters/hour) or (2.6 cubic feet/min.).  

- Automatic, Solid-State Temperature Controllers with individual circuit breakers for filter hot box (oven) and probe heat complete with Digital Display 

- Solid-State Temperature Control Output Relays w/ LED indicator (120 VAC/5A or 240 VAC/3A resistive load) 

- Digital Temperature Display with 6-channel Thermocouple Selector Switch to enable the operator to monitor all sampling system temperatures. 

- Vacuum Gauge to display system vacuum 0-100 kPa (0-30 in. Hg). 

- Digital Elapsed Timer monitors sampling time. 

- Manometer Zero switch enables the operator to zero the Orifice Tube manometer at any time before or during sampling, using direct-acting solenoid valves.

#### The Source Sampler Console contains Electrical, Thermocouple, and Vacuum sub-systems.

**Electrical Subsystem**

The    Source    Sampler    Console    is    factory-configured    for    120VAC/60Hz    electrical    power.  Configuration  for  240VAC/50Hz  operation  is  an  available  option.  The  Electrical  Schematics  for  the Source Sampler Console are presented in Appendix B.

Circuits  are  protected  by  front  panel  mounted  circuit  breakers  labeled  Main  Reset  (15  Amp  for 110VAC  or  10  Amp  for  220VAC).  Circuit  breakers  detect  and  interrupt  overload  and  short  circuit conditions,  providing  an  important  safety  factor.   If  the  circuit  breaker  opens,  or  “trips,”  indicating interruption of the circuit, investigate and repair the electrical fault. Then reset the breaker by pressing the circuit breaker switch. 

The  circuit  breaker  can  also  “nuisance  trip”  making it difficult to complete a test. To reduce the probability  of  nuisance  tripping,  the  circuit  start-up  sequence  can  reduce  the  power  surge.  The optimum start-up sequence is to power up the sample pump first, as it has the highest current and start-up  surge  demand.  The  filter  and  probe  heaters  should  be  powered  a  few  seconds  after  the  sample pump has started. 

The  electrical  subsystem  provides  switched  power  to several circuits, including:  MAIN POWER, PUMP POWER, MANOMETER ZERO, TIMER, PROBE heater and OVEN heater.

- The MAIN POWER switch controls all power to all circuits. Also, when this switch is on, the cabinet cooling fan should operate.  

- To activate the pump unit, plug the pump power cord into the Source Sampler Console receptacle and turn on the PUMP POWER switch. 

- The MANOMETER ZERO switch operates two (2) 3-way solenoid valves.  These valves open both legs of the ∆H side of the dual-column manometer to atmosphere so that the manometer fluid zero pressure level can be checked and if necessary, adjusted by the operator.  When the MANOMETER ZERO switch is ON, the valves will produce an audible “click.”  

- The timer will begin to count when the TIMER switch is turned on and stops when the switch is turned off.  The display is reset to zero with a push switch on the face of the timer display.  The timer is factory-set to read hour/minutes/seconds but can read minutes and tenths of minutes if specified in the purchase order. 

- To activate the heaters in the filter compartment (Hot Box) and the probe heater turn on the switches labeled FILTER and PROBE. The indicator lights on the SD31 Temperature automatic controllers will illuminate.  The Temperature Controllers are factory Adjust the dials to approximately 120°C (248°F) and check the temperature display to verify if the heaters are working.  Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize and verify operation of the circuits.

**Thermocouple Subsystem**

The  thermocouple  subsystem  displays,  measures  and/or  provides  feedback  for  the  temperature controls  critical  to  isokinetic  sampling  operation. The thermocouple system consists of Type-K thermocouples, extension wires, male/female connectors, receptacles, a 7-channel selector switch and a digital temperature display with internal compensating junction. 

There  are  automatic  temperature  controllers  for  probe  and  filter  oven  heat  which  receive temperature feedback signals from the electrical subsystem to control and maintain temperatures within  range  of  the  set  point.    The  temperature  controllers  are  solid-state  digital  programmable devices. The thermocouple electrical diagram is presented in the Electrical Schematic. 

**Vacuum Subsystem**

The vacuum subsystem consists of an external vacuum pump assembly, quick-connects, internal fittings,  two  (2)  control  valves  (Coarse  and  Fine), an orifice meter and a dual-column inclined manometer. 

The  external  vacuum  pump  assembly  provides  the  vacuum  for  extracting  the  gas  sample  from the stack and then through the various components of the isokinetic source sampling system. 

The  sample  flow  rate  is  controlled  by  the  Coarse  Control  Valve  and  the  Fine  Increase  Valve.  The  Coarse  Control  Valve  is  a  ball  valve  with  a  90° handle rotation from closed to full open.  This valve blocks the flow from the SAMPLE inlet quick-connect to the Vacuum Pump inlet. 

The Fine Increase Valve is a needle-type valve with four (4) turns from closed to full open.  The Fine  Increase  Valve  allows  flow  to  re-circulate  from  the  pump  outlet  back  to  the  pump  inlet.  This dual valve configuration enables very precise control of the sample flow rate. 

A calibrated Orifice Tube located on the outlet of the Dry Gas Meter, indicates the sample flow rate.  The orifice pressure drop is measured on the∆H (front or orange) side of the dual-column manometer.  The stack gas velocity pressure drop is measured on the ∆p (back or red) side of the manometer.  By observing the orifice reading (∆H) on the manometer, the operator can quickly adjust  the  sample  flow  rate  using  the  Fine  Increase Valve so that the sample is extracted under isokinetic conditions.

The  Manometer  Zero  switch  on  the  front  panel  enables  the  operator  to  adjust  the ∆H  manometer before  or  during  a  sampling  run.    By  switching  to  ON,  solenoid  valves  are  actuated  to  vent  the pressure lines to atmosphere and the operator can adjust the manometer’s fluid level using the knobs located  at  the  bottom  of  the  manometer.    To  zero  the  pitot  tube  manometer,  the  pitot  lines  can  be disconnected at the quick-connects on the Source Sampler Console.

**External Vacuum Pump Unit**

The External Pump Unit provides the vacuum that draws the sample from the stack.  The pump assembly attaches to the Source Sampler Console by non-reversible 9.525-mm (3/8-inch) quick-connects  and  an  electrical  receptacle.    Two  interchangeable  pump  styles  are  available:  the  E-0523  lubricated  rotary-vane  pump;  and  the  E-DAA  dual  diaphragm  non-lubricated  pump.  The E-0523 is a rotary vane pump that requires lubrication. The  pump  is  shipped  from  the  factory  without  oil.  Thus,  the  lubricator  jar  will  need  to  be unscrewed and filled approximately ¾ full with lightweight lubricating oil (Gast AD220, SAE-10 or SAE-5).  Both pump assemblies are available in either 120VAC or 240VAC operation. Please see Chapter  6  Maintenance  and  Troubleshooting  for  additional  information  on  Apex  Instruments pump units. 

The External Pump Unit contains: 

- The Vacuum Pump, 

- Adjustable Lubricator (E-0523 only), 

- Two (2) 1.524-m (5-ft) hose extensions with 9.525-mm (3/8-inch) quick-connects configured with male connector on the pressure side and female connector on the suction side 

- Enclosure Options: 

a.A rigid aluminum frame that protects the pump and allows easy access.   

b.A hinged enclosure is available for either pump style. 

c.Black Polyethylene case with molded handles and removable covers. 

**Probe Assembly** 

The Probe Assembly consists of the following: 

- Probe Liner – 15.9mm (5/8in) OD tubing made from either Borosilicate Glass, Quartz, Stainless Steel, Inconel or Teflon), 

- Probe Heater - Removable rigid tube heater with coiled heating element, electric thermal insulation and thermocouple (Max Recommended Temperature: 260oC (500oF), 

- Probe Sheath – 25.4mm (1in) OD tube with quad-assembly attached that includes a replaceable, modular S-type pitot tube, stack thermocouple and a 6.35-mm (1/4-inch) OD stainless steel tube to collect a gas sample for Orsat analysis, 

- Small Parts Kit – Fittings to attach Nozzle to Probe Assembly. Fittings include: 15.9mm (5/8in) union, nut and ferrules along with o-rings and backer ring. 

**Probe Liner**

Standard Probe Liners are constructed from 15.9mm (5/8in) OD tubing and have #28 ball joints with o-ring groove attached. Liner materials available are borosilicate glass, quartz, stainless steel, inconel and  Teflon.  Teflon liners, straight liners and liners with integrated nozzles require a ball joint adapter. Table 1-4 list the temperature limits for Probe Liner Materials and Probe Configurations, respectively.

|Inconel or Hastelloy Sheath and Liner | 980°C (1800°F) |
|Inconel or Hastelloy Sheath and Quartz Liner |980°C (1800°F)|

**Probe Heater**

Apex  Instruments  Probe  Heaters  are  designed  to  maintain  the  temperature  of  the  sample  traveling through the probe at 120oC ± 14oC (248oF ± 25oF). Our design features a rigid tube heater with coiled heating element, electrical thermal insulation with integrated thermocouple and power cord sealed in silicone-impregnated  glass  insulation.    This  mandrel-type  heater  design  allows  for  liner  replacement without  removing  the  heating  element.  Standard  heaters  are  configured  for  120VAC  operation; 240VAC  configuration  is  available.  The  maximum  recommended  stack  exposure  temperature  is 260oC  (500oF).  Exposure  to  elevated  temperatures  can  damage  the  insulation  and  shorten  the  life  of the heater.

**Small Parts Kit**

Apex Instruments Small Parts Kit (PK-SP) includes15.9mm (5/8in) union, nut and ferrules along with o-rings and backer ring

*The Probe Assembly connects to the Modular Sample Case with the following connections:* 

- The  probe  sheath  is  mounted  to  the  Modular  Sample  Case  using  a  probe  clamp  that  is attached to the probe holder of the sample case. 

- Extending  from  the  probe  assembly  is  a  thermocouple male connector, which connects to female thermocouple connector of the Umbilical Cable. 

- An electrical plug connects to the electrical receptacle on the Modular Sample Case Hot Box. 

- The outlet ball of the Probe  Liner is inserted through the  entry hole of the Filter Oven (Hot Box) compartment until the back of the sheath is even with the inside of the sample case. 

- The pitot tube quick-connect lines, probe heater thermocouple, stack thermocouple and Orsat gas sample line are connected to the Source Sampler Console by the Umbilical Cable.

### Modular Sample Case 

The  Modular  Sample  Case  is  used  for  support,  protection  and  environmental  control  of  the glassware  in  the  sampling  train. Figure illustrates the major components and accessory connections  on  the  Modular  Sample  Case.  The  Modular Sample Case consists of an insulated heated  filter  compartment  (Hot  Box)  and  insulated  impinger  case  (Cold  Box).  The  Hot  Box features: 

- Insulated (1/2 inch ceramic) filter box with dimensions 24 x 24 x 60 cm  (9 1/2 x 9 1/2 x 23 1/2 inches), 

- 500-watt heating element, 

- Oven thermocouple with external thermocouple receptacle, 

- Dual access doors, 

- Handle and SS bail clip monorail attachment, 

- Removable stainless steel hinged probe clamp --19 cm length (71/2 inches), and 

- Stainless steel slides for connection/removal of impinger case. 

The Cold  Box holds the  sampling train impingers in an ice bath so that the stack  gas sample is cooled   as   it   passes   through   the   impingers   to   condense   the   water   vapor.   This   enables measurement  of  stack  gas  moisture  volume  so  that  stack  gas  density  can  be  calculated.  Most testers  have  multiple  Cold  Boxes  and  sets  of  impingers  for  rapid  turnaround  between  test  runs.  Cold Box features include:

- Durable polyethylene foam insulation plus pre-punched foam inserts for holding the impingers in place, 

- Slide on/off guides plus spring-loaded latch to prevent accidental slippage, 

- Fold down handle with rope centering guide, 

- High-strength plastic bracket for supporting the Umbilical Adapter 
- Drain fitting for water removal as ice melts. 

- Four different removable insulated Cold Boxes (Impinger Cases) are available: SB-3 holds 4 impingers, SB-4 holds 8 impingers, SB-5 holds up to 14 impingers and the SB-3C accepts inexpensive removable liners.

### Umbilical Cable with Umbilical Adapter 

The  Umbilical  Cable  connects  the  Modular  Sample  case  and  Probe  Assembly  section  of  the isokinetic  source  sampling  system  to  the  Source  Sampler  Console.    The  Umbilical  Cable contains: 

- The primary gas sample line (3/8 inch i.d., blue), 12.7-mm (1/2 inch o.d.) with male quick-connect to the Source Sampler Console and, at the opposite end, a 12.7-mm (1/2 inch) female quick-connect to the Umbilical Adapter. 

- Two (2) pitot lines, 6.35-mm (1/4 inch) with female quick-connects to the Probe Assembly and 6.35-mm (1/4 inch) male quick-connects to the Source Sampler Console.   The pitot lines are color-coded black and white for convenience. 

- Yellow line, 6.35-mm (1/4 inch), which is intended for collecting a gas sample for Orsat analysis, can be used as a spare pitot line. 


- Five (5) thermocouple extension cables for Type-K thermocouples, which terminate with full size connectors for durability.  The connectors have different diameter round pins to maintain proper polarity, and will not fully connect if reversed.  Each thermocouple extension wire in the Umbilical Cable is labeled and color-coded for temperature measurement of Stack, Probe, Oven (Hot Box), Exit (Cold Box), and Auxiliary (spare). 

- AC power lines for the heaters in the filter compartment (Hot Box) and Probe Assembly. The power cable terminates with a circular connector (military style) connector on each end.  The body of the circular connector is the ground conductor.  A line-up guide is placed on each connector’s end, and the retainer threads should be engaged for good contact.

- The Umbilical Cable is covered with a woven nylon mesh sheath to restrain the cable and reduce friction when moving the cable. 

- The Umbilical Adapter connects the outlet of the last glass impinger train to the Umbilical Cable and contains the cold box exit thermocouple.  This adapter serves as a strain relief between the Umbilical Cable and the glassware train.

### Glassware Sample Train 

The  sample  glassware  train  contains  the  filter  holder  for  collection  of  particulate  matter,  glass impingers  for  absorption  of  entrained  moisture,  and connecting glassware pieces. The  order  in  which  a  typical USEPA Method 5 glassware train is constructed is as follows:
